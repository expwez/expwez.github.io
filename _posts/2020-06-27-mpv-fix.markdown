## Description

By default, MPV-player keeps window size fixed to video's aspect ratio. I found this to be very annoying and unusable.

## Fix

### Arch
Create the MPV configuration file:
```bash 
cp -r /usr/share/doc/mpv/ ~/.config/
```
Add the next line into the file `~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf`:

```
keepaspect-window=no
```
Save and restart the player!

## Tags
The Google queries I tried to find the solution:
1. mpv scaling aspect ratio to the window size
2. mpv unlock window size from aspect ratio
3. mpv resize window undependently from aspect ratio
